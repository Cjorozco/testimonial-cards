# Testimonial Cards Project

This project creates testimonial cards for a website using HTML and CSS. Testimonials are quotes or statements from satisfied users, often displayed on websites to build credibility and trust. The goal of this project is to demonstrate various layout and positioning techniques while also ensuring the design is responsive for mobile and desktop views.

## Project Features

- **Responsive Design**: The testimonial cards adjust to different screen sizes, including mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Hover Animations**: Interactive hover animations are applied to each testimonial card to improve user experience.
- **Carousel for Mobile Devices**: A scrollable testimonial carousel is implemented for screens smaller than 768px using CSS `scroll-snap`, enhancing the display of testimonials on mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For creating the structure of the testimonial cards.
- **CSS3**: For styling the testimonial cards, implementing animations, and ensuring responsiveness.
